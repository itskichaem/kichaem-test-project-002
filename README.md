## Contributing

### 1. Create a branch off of `main`

### 2. Do your stuff

Make commits according to its purpose.For example, if you are building a new feature, don't do code cleanup. Do code cleanup in a separate commit (or better separate branch)

Commit message template: `[Commit Type][Author] Add user login`

**Commit types:**

- Feature
- Fix
- Fix Test
- Misc
- Test
- Adjustment

### 3. Push to Github often. Rebase often.

Pushing and pulling often reduces the chance of conflicts and being out of sync. Try to do this a few times a day.

### 4. When ready, create a Pull Request from your branch to `main` branch.

Tag the reviewers to review your PR.

### 5. Respond or address reviewers' feedback to your PR.

Be receptive to feedback, keep an open mind, and always assume positive intent. ❤️
